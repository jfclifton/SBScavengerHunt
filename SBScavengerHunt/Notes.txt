Home screen shows two options: create a hunt, find a hunt.

"Create a hunt" allows the Hunt Master to make a new Hunt record, give it
a description/explanation, and tag iBeacons as hunt targets. Each target
can have different hints based on proximity; out-of-range, far, near, immediate.

When the Hunt Master is done, he broadcasts the hunt for others to play.

Others enter a searching state when they tap "Find a hunt." receive the game data and play it
